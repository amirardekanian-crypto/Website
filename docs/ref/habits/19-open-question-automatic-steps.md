## Open question — automatic steps

Amir wants STEPS locked and filled from the athlete's health app, the way WORKOUT is
locked and filled from the programme. **This cannot be done from a website.** There is
no browser API for Apple Health or Android Health Connect, and Google's Fit REST API
(the one route that used to work server-to-server) was shut down on **30 June 2026**.

Three routes that would actually work, cheapest first:

1. **Apple Shortcuts automation (iOS, free).** The athlete builds a Shortcut —
   *Get Health Sample → Steps → Today → Get Contents of URL (POST)* — and a Personal
   Automation that runs it daily. It posts to a Supabase edge function that writes the
   number, and Proof reads it exactly like it reads workout days. No app store, no
   native build. Costs: iOS only, ~2 minutes of one-time setup per athlete, and Apple
   sometimes requires confirming the automation.
2. **An aggregator (Terra, Vital, Rook).** One API covering Apple Health, Health
   Connect, Fitbit, Garmin, Oura, Whoop. Real money monthly, and for Apple Health the
   athlete still installs the aggregator's companion app or we embed their SDK in a
   native app — so it does not remove the native requirement, it just outsources it.
3. **Wrap Proof in Capacitor and ship a real app.** Reads HealthKit and Health Connect
   natively and properly. Costs: Apple and Google developer accounts, review, builds,
   and ongoing maintenance — and it contradicts the standing "don't make my apps heavy"
   rule.

**Recommendation: option 1** for the athletes who want it, keeping manual entry as the
default for everyone else. It is free, needs no native app, and slots into the existing
server-fed pattern. Do not lock STEPS until a source exists, or athletes simply cannot
earn it.
