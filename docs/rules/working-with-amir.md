# Rules — how Amir works, and how to verify the live site

<!-- Rules for one area. The door is CLAUDE.md; the atlas is MAP.md. One rule per line, wording unchanged. -->

## How Amir works (preferences)
- **Ship it live, straight to `main`** (Amir, 2026-09-26). He iterates on the live site: commit and
  push `main` by itself, one push at a time (Pages deploys it; see *Verifying the live site*). A
  session that has to work on a branch (a cloud session) merges its PR the same day. Don't stop at
  "pushed to a branch".
- **Push back** when something's wrong or stale; fix at the **source** and keep the two language
  sites consistent on facts. He gives blunt feedback — that's normal, not a problem.
- **Verify before merging.** Render changes headless and check them.
- **Names should be cool, not literal.** Workout titles, article headlines, post hooks — Amir wants
  evocative, punchy names (e.g. "Banded Lower Burner"), not flat descriptions ("Bodyweight & Band
  Strength"). Put the literal description in a tag/subtitle. When unsure, offer 3–4 options and let him pick.


## Verifying the live site (important gotchas)
- **Python on Amir's PC is `python`**: `python3` there is the Microsoft Store stub and runs nothing
  (2026-09-27). A cloud session has `python3`; the `python3` commands below are for one.
- **Try the live fetch first — when it works it is the real proof — but it DEPENDS ON THE
  SESSION'S NETWORK POLICY, so a failure is not a failed deploy.** Some environments allow the
  host and some deny it: on 2026-09-13 `curl` to `amirardekani.com`, `www.` and the
  `github.io` origin all returned HTTP 000, and
  `curl -sS "$HTTPS_PROXY/__agentproxy/status"` named the reason — `connect_rejected`,
  "gateway answered 403 to CONNECT (policy denial)". Check that endpoint before spending any
  time on it, and **never poll a blocked host in a loop waiting for a deploy that already
  happened.** When it is blocked, the fallbacks are `git ls-remote origin main` (the commit is
  on the branch Pages serves) plus the **"pages build and deployment" run for that exact SHA
  reporting `conclusion: success`** — which, unlike a *missing* run, is a real signal.
  The apex 301s to `www`, so follow redirects, and diff what is served against your working copy:
  ```
  curl -sL -o /tmp/live.html https://amirardekani.com/coach.html   # -L matters: apex -> www
  python -c "import hashlib;a=open('/tmp/live.html','rb').read().replace(b'\r\n',b'\n');b=open('coach.html','rb').read().replace(b'\r\n',b'\n');print(hashlib.sha256(a).hexdigest()==hashlib.sha256(b).hexdigest())"
  ```
  A deleted file should 404 and a kept one should 200 — that check caught nothing but proves the
  whole commit shipped, not just the page you edited.
  ⚠ **Pick a served file as your marker.** `_config.yml` excludes the `.md` docs, so
  `amirardekani.com/CLAUDE.md` is a permanent 404 — polling one to confirm a docs-only commit
  waits for ever. A docs-only change has nothing to verify live; check `git ls-remote origin main`
  instead.
  ⚠ **That exclude list is explicit, not a glob — a new root doc or script is LIVE until you add
  it.** On 2026-09-13 `AFFILIATES.md`, `HABITS.md`, `QUESTS.md`, `XP_SYSTEM.md`, two root `.py`
  files, `scripts/` and three folder READMEs were all found serving HTTP 200, the docs as both
  `.md` and rendered `.html`. Adding a `.md`, `.py` or tooling folder means adding a line there.
- **Do not treat a missing Actions run as a failed deploy — but do not treat it as a successful one
  either. Ask the deployments API, which answers the question directly:**
  ```
  curl -sS "https://api.github.com/repos/amirardekanian-crypto/Website/deployments?environment=github-pages&per_page=5" \
    | python3 -c "import sys,json;[print(x['sha'][:8], x['created_at']) for x in json.load(sys.stdin)]"
  ```
  Unauthenticated and not proxy-blocked. **Your SHA in that list = it deployed. Absent = it did
  not.** Add `&sha=<full-sha>` to ask about one commit; an empty array is a real negative.
  The Actions list is a *weak* signal in both directions: the "pages build and deployment" run
  (`event: dynamic`) sometimes never appears for a commit that deployed fine (2026-08-09), and
  runs for an *earlier* SHA can appear twice.
  ⚠ **A merge can also be genuinely dropped, which is what the old wording would have missed.**
  On 2026-09-13 the merge API returned **502** while still merging `df3d601`; GitHub then created
  no Pages run *and* no deployment for it, so a change that was on `main` was never served. It was
  caught only because Amir asked "is this live?" and the deployments list said no. Two lessons:
  treat a 502 on merge as "verify everything downstream", and when the live fetch is blocked,
  **the deployments list is the strong signal, not the Actions list.**
  **You cannot force a rebuild from here** — `POST /pages/builds` returns
  `403 Access to this GitHub API path is not permitted through this proxy`. The fix is to land any
  real commit on `main`; the build deploys the whole tree, so the stranded change rides along. A
  docs-only commit works even though `_config.yml` excludes the `.md` files — `exclude` controls
  what is *served*, not whether a build runs.
  ⚠ **That API allows 60 calls an hour without a token** (`curl https://api.github.com/rate_limit`), and a
  rate-limit answer is a JSON *object*, so a poll loop that tests `len(...) != 0` reads it as "deployed". Seen
  2026-09-20, after a few minutes of polling. To wait for a deploy, poll the SERVED file for something only the
  new version has (`curl -sL https://amirardekani.com/<file> | grep -c '<new marker>'`), which has no quota.
  ⚠ **Push `main` BY ITSELF.** On 2026-09-20 three pushes in a row made with `git push origin main <other-branch>`
  (two refs at once, both at the same commit) got no "pages build and deployment" run at all, and the next push
  of `main` alone built within seconds. Not proven to be the cause, but it costs nothing to avoid. To see whether a
  run exists without spending the API quota, read the HTML page `https://github.com/<owner>/Website/actions`.
  Tell Amir to **hard-refresh** to bypass browser cache.
- For visual checks: serve with `python3 -m http.server` and screenshot with Chromium at
  `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome`. Two headless quirks: scroll-reveal hides
  below-fold content (inject `.reveal{opacity:1!important;transform:none!important}`) and the hero is
  `min-height:100vh` (shrink it, e.g. `.hero{min-height:520px!important}`, to capture lower sections).
- Stale **CSS cache** can render unsized elements huge (it once blew up the nav logo). Inline
  width/height on critical lockups as a safeguard.


## habits.html has a pre-commit guard — set it up once per clone
A stray backtick inside an HTML comment that sits inside a JS template literal has broken
the live app **twice in one afternoon** (2026-08-01): it silently terminates the template
literal, the parser can resync into something that still "parses" but never reaches the
app's own boot call, and the site sits on its loading screen forever with **nothing in the
console**. It even reached production once, via a commit nobody ran on purpose — an
external process on this machine (auto-commit tool, unclear which) picked up habits.html
mid-edit while it was deliberately broken for a test and pushed it straight to `main`,
which is what GitHub Pages serves from. Live for about 15 minutes before caught and
reverted (`e85969c`).

`scripts/check_js_syntax.py` and `scripts/check_habits_boots.py` now guard against this —
the first catches the exact backtick-in-comment pattern deterministically (a real parse
check alone is **not** reliable here, since the resync doesn't always throw), the second
proves the app actually renders content into `#app`, not just that it parses. Both are
wired into `.githooks/pre-commit`, which blocks a commit that touches habits.html unless
it passes both.

**This only runs if `core.hooksPath` points at the tracked `.githooks/` directory** — that
is a per-clone git config, not something `git clone` sets up on its own. Run once per
clone:
```
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```
Skip a check only in a genuine emergency with `git commit --no-verify` — that is exactly
what let the incident above through, so read the errors first.
