# Idea bank

Every idea pitched through `/ideas`, with its status. Read before a run so nothing is pitched twice;
update the status when Amir reacts. Statuses: `pitched` · `picked` · `built` (commit) · `parked` · `rejected`.

Brief: product strategy across assessment → … → adaptation; connected information, not features;
"this app actually understands my training".
